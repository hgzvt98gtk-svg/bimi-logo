## Purpose

This repository contains the `logo-bimi.svg` artwork intended to be hosted by a domain that publishes a BIMI record. Use the logo only when you own it or have permission from the rights holder.

## Usage

1. Confirm that you own or are authorized to use the logo.
2. Host `logo-bimi.svg` at a stable HTTPS URL on the relevant domain.
3. Publish a BIMI DNS TXT record for the sending domain.
4. Validate the hosted SVG and DNS configuration with your email provider and a BIMI validator.

Example DNS record:

```text
default._bimi.example.com TXT "v=BIMI1; l=https://example.com/path/to/logo-bimi.svg;"
```

Replace `example.com` and the SVG URL with your own domain and hosting location. Requirements can vary between receiving mail systems; BIMI may also require sender authentication and, depending on the deployment, an appropriate certificate.

## File requirements

The hosted logo should:

- Remain a self-contained SVG.
- Be served over HTTPS.
- Avoid scripts, external resources, and unsupported SVG features.
- Preserve the intended artwork and proportions.
- Be tested with a BIMI/SVG validator before publication.

Do not modify, redistribute, or use the logo commercially without permission from the rights holder.
